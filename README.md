# casette_synth 

The goal is to make a simple casette tape synthesizer that can be played with a midi keyboard.  

**I got the idea for the tape synth from [schollz](url) who was inspired by Onde Magn√©tique amoung other people. The YouTube video ["How to Hack a Casette Player"](url) was also helper for understanding how to add voltage control to the casette, and code a midi controller to modulate voltages for each note.
